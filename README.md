Computational Practice 1
#1. stroke(random(60, 70), 100, 90);
line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
  noStroke();

#2. 
if (random(1000) > 999) {
    fill(255);
    rect(0, 0, width, height-15); // white box which cuts
    h = 10;
it comes by whenever the number of grass reaches its maximum number which is 1000

#3. initial height
#4. height-10 is the set y. it is to define how the it starts from height-10 which is also stated for the ground - “rect (0,height-10,width,10)”
